title: "Locating KBAs: An automated workflow for identifying potential Key Biodiversity Areas"
output: html_document
---


The following workflow is designed to facilitate and streamline the scoping analysis for KBA identification by leveraging the free and open access data of GBIF. 

The workflow is divided into three main steps:

1. [Select the species in the study area that could potentially trigger KBA criteria.](#first)

2. [Identify the sites where the potential trigger species occur in significant numbers.](#second)

3. [Cite the sources of information used.](#third)

You may want to add/remove steps or modify the code based on your interests.

Before running the code, I recommend visiting this [link](https://portals.iucn.org/library/sites/library/files/documents/2016-048.pdf) and familiarizing yourself with the different KBA criteria and their associated thresholds. 

# Setup 

```{r setup, echo=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE, warning = FALSE)
knitr::opts_knit$set(root.dir = rprojroot::find_rstudio_root_file())
```


Load the libraries

```{r load libraries, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}

```


Define initial configuration parameters 

```{r initial parameters}
# Increase the time allowed to access URLs
curlSetOpt(timeout = 8000)

# Disable scientific notation
options(scipen=999)

```


To access GBIF data, you must have an account on the platform. If you do not have one, create it by entering the following [link](https://www.gbif.org/user/profile). Additionally, to access IUCN information, you must request an API key [here](https://apiv3.iucnredlist.org/).

Once you have both the account and the API key, you can define new variables to store them. The following are just examples that you can replace with your information. 


```{r user info example, eval=FALSE}
GBIF_USER <- "pp"
GBIF_PWD <- "pphh"
GBIF_EMAIL <- "pp@gmail.com"
IUCN_REDLIST_KEY = "12345"
```


# 1. Select potential trigger species {#first}

**1.1.** The first thing we will do is download the occurrence records present in our study area. Save the shapefile of your study area in the data folder. For this example, we will focus the scope analysis on the department of Quindío in Colombia. 


```{r load study area}
# Load shapefile of the study area  
st_area <- st_read("data/Quindio.shp", quiet = TRUE)

# Convert shapefile into a Well Known Text object (WKT)
wkt <- wellknown::sf_convert(st_area)
```

You can also set additional conditions for the data you want to download. Since we are going to explore the spatial location of potential trigger species, I will only download records that have coordinates. Also, I will only use records taken recently.

```{r request GBIF records}

# Download GBIF records
download <- occ_download(
  
  # Records with coordinates
  pred("hasCoordinate", TRUE), 
  
  # Records taken between 2017 and 2021
  pred_gte("year", 2017), 
  pred_lte("year", 2021),  
  
  # Records that fall within the study area
  pred_within(wkt),
  
  # Records that fall within Colombia
  pred("country", "CO"), 
  
  # Format of the resulting file 
  format = "SIMPLE_CSV",
  
  # GBIF account information
  user = GBIF_USER, 
  pwd = GBIF_PWD, 
  email = GBIF_EMAIL)


```

After submitting the download request to GBIF, we must wait a few minutes for it to be accepted.

```{r download status}
# Check download status
occ_download_meta(download)$status
```

Once the request status is successful, we can download the data

```{r download data, message=FALSE}
# download the data 
z <- occ_download_get(download, path = "data/", overwrite = TRUE)
```

```{r import GBIF data}
# Import data to an R dataset
data <- occ_download_import(z)
```

Now, we will plot the study area and the records downloaded from GBIF, to verify that all the points fall within our polygon of interest.

```{r map all points}
# Turn dataset into an sf object
data_sf <- st_as_sf(data, coords = c("decimalLongitude", "decimalLatitude"), crs = 4326)

# Plot points and study area
ggplot(data = st_area) +
  geom_sf() +
  xlab("Longitude") + ylab("Latitude") + # Change x and y labels 
  geom_sf(color = "black", fill = "grey") + # Change polygon and line color
  geom_sf(data=data_sf, color = 'green') + # Add occurrence records 
  annotation_scale() + # Add an annotation scale
  annotation_north_arrow(location='br') + # Add the north arrow to the bottom right
  ggtitle("Occurrence records that fall within the study area") # Add title to map 

```



**1.2**. We will now clean the occurrence dataset because this reduces the probability of including erroneous records and ensures that the data are suitable for the analysis (Gueta & Carmel, 2016). 


```{r initial records, echo=FALSE}
print(paste("Number of initial records:", nrow(data)))
```


```{r remove duplicates}

# Remove duplicates
data_wDuplicates <- data %>%
  
  # Remove records that have the same combination of the following variables 
  distinct(decimalLongitude,decimalLatitude,speciesKey,datasetKey,eventDate,individualCount,basisOfRecord, .keep_all = TRUE) 

```

```{r records without duplicates, echo=FALSE}
print(paste("Number of records without duplicates:", nrow(data_wDuplicates)))
```


Records obtained from GBIF may have issues and flags that indicate common quality problems. Therefore, it is important to explore the issues present in our dataset and remove the records that we consider inappropriate for the scoping analysis


```{r GBIF issues}
# Examine the GBIF issues present in our dataset
data_issues <- str_split(unique(data_wDuplicates$issue), ";") %>% 
  
  # Get a list of the issues present in the dataset 
unlist() %>% unique()
```



```{r GBIF issues defintions}
# Obtain the definition of the GBIF issues present in our dataset
GBIF_issues <- gbif_issues() %>%
  
  filter(issue %in% data_issues)

print(paste(GBIF_issues$issue, GBIF_issues$description))
```


If you want to delete records with specific problems, you can use the following example code. However, in this case, I will not delete any of the records with issues. 

```{r GBIF issues exclutions, eval=FALSE}

data_wIssues <- data_wDuplicates[which(grepl(paste(c("TAXON_MATCH_HIGHERRANK", "INSTITUTION_MATCH_NONE"), collapse = "|"), data_wDuplicates$issue) == FALSE), ]

```


```{r records without issues, echo=FALSE}
print(paste("Number of presence records after removing issues:", nrow(data_wDuplicates)))
```


Next, we will remove the records that are not identified at least at the species level, because the thresholds associated with the species-based criteria are designed to be applied at this taxonomic level (KBA Standards and Appeals Committee, 2020). 

We will also delete the absence records, as they do not provide information on the species present in the study area.

```{r species level}
data_spLevel <- data_wDuplicates %>% 
  
  # Select the records where the taxon rank is at least species 
  filter(taxonRank == "SPECIES" | taxonRank == "SUBSPECIES" | taxonRank == "VARIETY") %>% 
  
  # Select presence records
  filter(occurrenceStatus == "PRESENT") %>%
  
  # drop levels
  droplevels()


```

```{r records species level, echo=FALSE}
print(paste("Number of records identified at least at the species level:", nrow(data_spLevel)))
```


The taxonomy used for KBA identification should be consistent with the taxonomic backbone of the IUCN Red List, i.e., the Species Information Service, SIS (KBA Committee on Standards and Appeals, 2020). Thus, we will exclude records with unrecognized species names based on the IUCN Red List assessments.

In addition, we will eliminate the records of species introduced (non-native) in our study area since these cannot trigger KBAs (KBA Committee on Standards and Appeals, 2020). 

```{r species table}
# Create a table with the species names present in the occurrence dataset
species <- data_spLevel %>% 
  
  # Get unique species names 
  distinct(species, .keep_all = TRUE) %>% 
  
  # Keep species taxonomy
  select(kingdom, phylum, class, order, family, genus, species) %>%
  
  # Create new columns 
  dplyr::mutate(IUCN_name = NA_character_, origin = NA_character_)
```



```{r total species, echo=FALSE}
print(paste("Number of species:", nrow(species)))
```


```{r species synonyms and origin}
# For each species:
for (i in 1:nrow(species)){

  # Verify if the species name is a synonym of the IUCN accepted name
  x <- rl_synonyms(name = species$species[i], key = IUCN_REDLIST_KEY, parse = TRUE)
  
  # If there are no synonyms 
  if (length(x$result) == 0) {
    # then leave the original name 
    species$IUCN_name[i] <- species$species[i]
  } else {
    # otherwise extract the IUCN accepted name 
    species$IUCN_name[i] <-  x$result$accepted_name[1]
  }
  
  # Slow down the loop for 3 seconds as too many frequent calls can temporarily block access to the IUCN API
  Sys.sleep(3)
  
  # Extract the countries where the species is present and its origin (native vs introduced)
  x2 <- rl_occ_country(species$IUCN_name[i], key = IUCN_REDLIST_KEY, parse = TRUE)
  
  
  # If there are no countries, it is because the species name does not have a red list assessment. This could be checked manually. 
  if (length(x2$result) == 0) {
    species$IUCN_name[i] <- "CHECK"
  } else {
    
    # If the country of the study area appears in the list, extract the origin in that country
    if ("Colombia" %in% x2$result$country) {
      species$origin[i] <- x2$result$origin[x2$result$country == "Colombia"]
    } else {
      
      # Otherwise, we will have to verify the origin using other sources, e.g. national checklists. 
      species$origin[i] <- "CHECK"
    }
  }    
  # Slow down the loop for 3 seconds as too many frequent calls can temporarily block access to the IUCN API
  Sys.sleep(3)
  
  # Remove temporary variables
  rm(x, x2)
  
}
```


With the resulting table, we can easily identify the species that have a red list assessment and are considered native to our study area. We can also identify the species for which we need to search for more information to establish their origin (native vs. introduced) by locating the CHECK records.


```{r species table 1, echo=FALSE}
# Show preview of the resulting table 
datatable(species, caption = "Table 1: preview of the table used to compare GBIF and IUCN taxonomy and to identify the origin of the species present in the dataset", rownames = FALSE, filter="top", options = list(pageLength = 5, scrollX=TRUE))

```


```{r first graph, fig.align = 'center'}

# Create a table with the number of species that have IUCN information and for the different types of origin, including the CHECK values.
First_graph <- data.frame(table(species$origin)) %>%
  rename(Count = Freq) %>%
  mutate(group = "Species with IUCN information")


First_graph2 <-data.frame(Var1= "CHECK",
                          Count= length(which(species$IUCN_name == "CHECK")),
                          group= "Species without IUCN information") %>%
  
  # Join the number of species without IUCN information
  rbind(First_graph) %>%
  
  # Organize levels by reverse alphabetical order
  arrange(desc(Var1)) %>%
  
  # Calculate the y position for count labels 
  group_by(group) %>%
  mutate(label_y = cumsum(Count) - 0.5 * Count)


# Plot number of species with and without IUCN information
ggplot(First_graph2, aes(fill=Var1, y=Count, x=group)) + 
  geom_bar(position="stack", stat="identity")  +
  
  # Remove x label
  xlab("") + 
  
  # Define y label 
  ylab("Number of species") + 
  
  # Add count labels 
  geom_text(aes(y = label_y, label = Count), colour = "white")

```

Finally, after reviewing the CHECK records, we will remove the species that do not have a red list assessment and / or are considered introduced to the study area. 


```{r non-trigger species}

species <- species %>%
  
  # Remove species not assessed by the IUCN
  filter(IUCN_name != "CHECK") %>%
  
  # Remove non-native species 
  filter(origin != "CHECK") %>%
  filter(origin != "Introduced") %>% 
  
  # drop levels
  droplevels()


```

```{r records species 2, echo=FALSE}
print(paste("Number of species that have a red list assessment and are considered native to the study area:", nrow(species)))
```


**1.3.** We will now identify the species that could potentially trigger KBA criteria, specifically criteria A1 (for threatened species), B2 (for co-occurring geographically restricted species), and D1 (for demographic aggregations).


```{r new columns species}

species <- species %>% 
  
  # Create columns for the table that we will use to identify the criteria that each species could potentially trigger
  mutate(commonName =  NA_character_, global_RedListCategory =  NA_character_, redList_Criteria = NA_character_,
         geographicallyRestricted =  NA_character_, migratory =  NA_character_)


```

For criterion A1 we will identify threatened species (Vulnerable, Endangered and Critically Endangered) based on the IUCN Red List assessments.

```{r IUCN category}
# Go over each species name (accepted IUCN name) 
for (i in 1:nrow(species)) {
  
  # Access the red list category and the evaluation criteria for the species
  x <- rl_search(species$IUCN_name[i], key = IUCN_REDLIST_KEY, parse = TRUE)
  
  # Fill in the table with the information retrieved
  species$commonName[i]  <- x$result$main_common_name
  species$global_RedListCategory[i] <- x$result$category
  species$redList_Criteria[i] <- x$result$criteria
  
  
  # Slow down the loop for 3 seconds as too many frequent calls can temporarily block access to the IUCN API
  Sys.sleep(3)
  
  # Remove temporary variable
  rm(x)
}

```


```{r second graph, fig.align = 'center'}
# Create a table with the number of species per IUCN category
Second_graph <- data.frame(table(species$global_RedListCategory)) %>%
  rename(Category = Var1)

# Sum the counts for the LC and LR/lc categories
Second_graph <- Second_graph %>%
  
  # Add a row that sums the count for categories LC and LR/lc
  add_row(Category = "LC or LR/lc", Freq = sum(Second_graph$Freq[which(Second_graph$Category == "LC")], Second_graph$Freq[which(Second_graph$Category == "LR/lc")])) %>%
  
  # Remove the rows of the categories of LC and LR/lc
  filter(Category %nin% c("LC", "LR/lc")) %>% droplevels()


# Plot
ggplot(Second_graph, aes(x=Category, y=Freq, fill=Category)) +
  geom_bar(stat="identity")+theme_minimal() +
  
  # Change order of levels
  scale_x_discrete(limits=c("LC or LR/lc", "NT", "VU", "EN", "CR", "DD")) + 
  
  # Change x label
  xlab("Red list category") + 
  
  # Add label with the number of species
  geom_text(aes(label=Freq), position=position_dodge(width=0.9), vjust=-0.25) +
  
  # Change y label
  ylab("Number of species")

```

For criterion B2 we will identify range-restricted species using the list provided by the KBA [website](http://www.keybiodiversityareas.org/working-with-kbas/proposing-updating/criteria-tools). Use that link to download the file, remove the merged rows that provide contextualization information, and save to your data folder.

```{r KBA list}

# Load list of geographically restricted species
Range_restricted_species <- read.csv("data/Restricted_range_species_B2.csv", stringsAsFactors = FALSE, sep = ";")

```


```{r range-restricted}

# Identify the index of species that appear in the geographically restricted species list
geographicallyRestricted <- which(species$IUCN_name %in% Range_restricted_species$binomial)

for (i in geographicallyRestricted){
  
  # Create a temporary variable that holds the information for a single species
  x <- Range_restricted_species %>%
    filter(binomial == species$IUCN_name[i]) %>%
    droplevels()
  
  # If there is only one range type for that species, then assign that value
  if (length(unique(x$Rangetype)) == 1) {
    species$geographicallyRestricted[i] <- x$Rangetype[1]
    # Otherwise, assign all the values (e.g. breeding and non-breeding)
  } else {
    species$geographicallyRestricted[i] <- (x %>% summarise(toString(Rangetype)) %>% pull())
  }
  
  # Remove temporary variable
  rm(x)
}

```


Since migratory species may have a restricted range in their non-breeding, breeding or resident grounds, it is important to check that we are including species that have a restricted range in our country of interest.

We can use resources such as the [Birdlife Data Zone](http://datazone.birdlife.org/home) to manually review the following list and assign the corresponding value to the geographicallyRestricted column (resident, breeding, non-breeding or NA), according to the status in our country of interest. 


```{r non-resident range-restricted}

# Review the species that are not range-restricted residents
print(species[!is.na(species$geographicallyRestricted) & species$geographicallyRestricted != "Resident", c("species", "geographicallyRestricted")])

```


```{r third graph, fig.align = 'center'}
# Create table with the number of range-restricted species
Third_graph <- data.frame(table(species$geographicallyRestricted, useNA = "ifany")) %>%
  rename(Type = Var1)

# Plot number of species that are range restricted
ggplot(Third_graph, aes(x=Type, y=Freq, fill=Type)) +
  geom_bar(stat="identity")+theme_minimal() +
  
  # Add label with the number of species 
  geom_text(aes(label=Freq), position=position_dodge(width=0.9), vjust=-0.25) +
  
  # Change y label
  ylab("Number of species")

```


Criterion D1 is suitable for application to migratory species that form seasonal aggregations (KBA Standards and Appeals Committee, 2020). Therefore, we will identify migratory birds, and then we will have to verify if they congregate in our study area, using, for example, expert knowledge. We will use the [Birdlife Data Zone](http://datazone.birdlife.org/home) to identify the migratory birds. 

```{r migratory birds}

# Create a vector with the index of species that are birds
Aves <- which(species$class == "Aves")

# For each bird species 
for (i in Aves){
  
  # Specify the birdlife base url
  base_url <- paste("http://datazone.birdlife.org/species/factsheet/")
  
  # Create a character vector with the name of the species that will be included in the url (everything must be in lower case and without special characters)
  species_url <- paste(tolower(str_replace_all((str_replace_all(str_trim(species$commonName[i], side = "both"), "[^[:alnum:][:blank:]+-]", "")), " ", "-")), 
                       tolower(str_replace_all(species$IUCN_name[i], " ", "-")), sep = "-")
  
  # Paste base url with species name
  complete_url <- paste0(base_url, species_url)
  
  # Add a /details at the end, to access to the "Data table and detailed info" tab of the birdlife webpage 
  complete_url <- paste0(complete_url, "/details")
  
  # Turn HTML document into XML
  html  <- read_html(complete_url)
  
  species$migratory[i] <- html %>% html_nodes("table") %>% 
    
    # Extract table that has information on migratory status 
    .[3] %>% html_table(fill = TRUE) %>%
    
    # Extract migratory status 
    as.data.frame() %>% .[1,2]
  
  # Remove temporary variables
  rm(base_url, species_url, complete_url, html)
  
}

```


```{r fourth graph, fig.align = 'center'}

# Create a table with the number of migratory bird species
Fourth_graph <- data.frame(table(species$migratory)) %>%
  rename(Type = Var1)

# Plot number of migratory bird species
ggplot(Fourth_graph, aes(x= reorder(Type, -Freq) , y=Freq, fill=Type)) +
  geom_bar(stat="identity")+ theme_minimal() +
  
  # Add label with the number of species 
  geom_text(aes(label=Freq), position=position_dodge(width=0.9), vjust=-0.25) +
  
  # Change y label
  ylab("Number of species") + 
  
  # Change x label
  xlab("Type of migrant")
```

```{r list of potential trigger species}

# Select the potential trigger species
ptrigger_species <- species %>%
  
  # Filter threatened, range-restricted and / or migratory species
  filter(global_RedListCategory %in% c("VU", "EN", "CR") | !is.na(geographicallyRestricted)  | migratory %nin% c(NA, "not a migrant")) %>%
  
  # Arrange by red list category
  droplevels() %>% arrange(global_RedListCategory)
```

**The following table shows the species that could potentially trigger KBA criteria in our study area.**

```{r list of potential trigger species number, echo=FALSE}

```{r list of potential trigger species table , echo=FALSE}
# Show preview of the resulting table

```


# 2. Identify the sites where the potential trigger species occur in significant numbers {#second}


**2.1** We will use a function that will help us to visually identify the sites where the potential trigger species have large counts or where there are multiple records of potential trigger species.

The function creates an interactive map showing the location of records that meet a user-defined threshold of individuals. It also allows to insert a grid and count the total number of records that belong to potential trigger species per cell, or the number of records that reach a count threshold per cell. The function also allows you to explore the spatial relationship between the points and a polygon different than the study area.


The arguments of the function are the following:

* *GBIFtable:* dataset. The clean GBIF occurrence dataset 

* *potential_triggerSpecies:* dataset. Table containing only the possible trigger species for criteria A1, B2 and D1

* *study_area:* sf object. Polygon of the study area 

* *criteria:* character. It can be "A1", "B2", "D1" or empty if you want to include all three criteria

* *selected_species:* character vector. Names of the potential trigger species you want to evaluate. It can be left empty if you want to evaluate all potential trigger species

* *individualCount_filter:* number. Filter to include only records that reach a specific number of individuals. It can be left empty

* *gridCell_Size:* number. Cell size for the grid in meters

* *extra_polygon:* sf object. Another polygon that you want to add to the map

For this example, I will evaluate the species that could trigger criterion A1 (threatened species), as they do not require any additional review of information. 

```{r select species to plot}
species_map <- ptrigger_species %>% 
  
  # Select endangered species 
  filter(global_RedListCategory %in% c("VU", "EN", "CR")) %>%
  
  # Export species names to a character vector

Explore the map, turning the following layers on and off:

* *Records without individual count filter:*  all the records. 

* *Records with individual count filter:* records that meet the count threshold.

* *Records weighted by individual counts:* all records, highlighting the points with the largest counts. 

* *Grid without individual count filter:* Grid showing the cells with the highest number of species records. 

* *Grid with individual count filter:* Grid showing the cells with the highest number of species records that meet the count threshold. 


If the number of species is too large and the legend expands beyond the frame, you can click on the points to see the species names. By clicking on the points, you will also see the individual count and information related to the selected criteria, in this case, the red list category. By clicking on the cells in the grid, you will see the number of records and species that intersect with that cell.



```{r apply function 1, message= FALSE}
# Apply function
map_of_large_counts(GBIFtable = data_spLevel, potential_triggerSpecies = ptrigger_species, study_area = st_area, criteria = "A1", selected_species = species_map, individualCount_filter = 15, gridCell_Size = 5000, extra_polygon = polygon)

```


**2.2.** Another option to identify sites with significant numbers of potential trigger species is to compare the counts with the quantitative thresholds of each criterion (A1, B2, and D1). We will also include criterion B1 of individual geographically restricted species, which are identified based on the threshold. **However**, please remember that KBAs are defined based on counts of mature individuals, and therefore this is just a scoping exercise. 


To calculate the thresholds, we need the global number of mature individuals for each species. This information is available for various species on the IUCN portal, but this data cannot be accessed via the IUCN API. Therefore, we will focus on birds, as this information is also available in the Birdlife Data Zone.

```{r global number mature individuals birds}
# Create a new column to hold the global number of mature individuals 
ptrigger_species <- ptrigger_species %>% mutate(global_matureIndividuals = NA)

# Identify the index of potential trigger species that are birds
Aves_trigger <- which(ptrigger_species$class == "Aves")
```


```{r number trigger birds, echo=FALSE}
print(paste("Number of potential trigger birds:", length(Aves_trigger)))

```

```{r global number mature individuals}

The following function creates an interactive map showing the location of records that meet the threshold of individuals for the criteria evaluated (A1, B1, B2, and D1). Click on the points to see the species name and the criteria that could potentially be triggered given the threshold reached. The function also allows you to explore the spatial relationship between the points and a polygon different than the study area.


The arguments of the function are the following:
  
* *GBIFtable:* dataset. The clean GBIF occurrence dataset 

* *potential_triggerSpecies:* dataset. Table containing only the possible trigger species for criteria A1, B2 and D1

* *study_area:* sf object. Polygon of the study area 

* *extra_polygon:* sf object. Another polygon that you want to add to the map

```



Visual inspection of both maps allows us to identify the species that have the greatest potential to trigger KBA criteria due to their characteristics and recorded counts across the study area. In addition, they allow us to locate the most important sites for these species.

The first map highlights the following species as those with the most potential to activate criterion A1:

* *Ognorhynchus icterotis* (Yellow-eared Parrot)
* *Bolborhynchus ferrugineifrons* (Rufous-fronted Parakeet)
* *Hapalopsittaca fuertesi* (Indigo-winged Parrot)

These species show large population counts in the northeastern, southeastern, and southern parts of the study area.

The second map draws attention to the same sites and species, in addition to *Penelope perspicax* (Cauca Guan). When comparing the records from our scoping analysis and the location of already identified KBAs (shown in purple on both maps), we can see that there is a good overlap at the KBAs of Alto Quindío, Cañón del Río Barbas y Bremen, and Bosques Altoandinos de Génova. However, we can also identify some important sites that are currently not recognized as KBAs. Increasing efforts to conduct surveys and apply KBA criteria would be more effective in these areas.


```{r gaps map 1, fig.cap="Important sites highlighted on the first map, which are not currently recognized as KBAs", echo=FALSE, out.width = '100%'}
knitr::include_graphics("outputs/Map_1.png")
```


```{r gaps map 2, fig.cap="Important sites highlighted on the second map, which are not currently recognized as KBAs", echo=FALSE, out.width = '100%'}

# 3. Cite sources {#third}

To cite the dataset downloaded from GBIF we will use the gbif_citation function.

```{r cite GBIF}

# Cite GBIF dataset 
gbif_citation(z)$download
```

If you are interested in citing the Red List API version use the following function

```{r cite IUCN API version}
rl_citation(key = IUCN_REDLIST_KEY)

```


If you want to cite the information of a species retrieved using the rredlist package, you can cite it using the rl_citation function


```{r cite IUCN}
# Example:
rl_sp_citation("Penelope perspicax", key = IUCN_REDLIST_KEY, parse = TRUE)$result$citation

```


Finally, if you want to cite the Birdlife Data Zone webpage for a specific species, use:

```{r cite Birdlife Data Zone}


# Specify the birdlife base url
base_url <- paste("http://datazone.birdlife.org/species/factsheet/")

# Create a character vector with the name of the species that will be included in the url (everything must be in lower case and without special characters)
species_url <- paste("cauca-guan", 
                     "penelope-perspicax", sep = "-")

# Paste base url with species name
complete_url <- paste0(base_url, species_url)

# Turn HTML document into XML
html  <- read_html(complete_url)

# Access the citation 
cite_BDZ <- html %>% html_nodes("hr+ p") %>% html_text() %>% str_replace_all("[\r\n]" , "")

# Remove double spaces 
cite_BDZ <- gsub("\\s+", " ", str_trim(cite_BDZ))

print(cite_BDZ)

```
